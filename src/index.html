            <p>I'm a dedicated ER nurse who found an unexpected passion in the world of custom artisanal conchas. Balancing the intensity of my nursing career with the sweetness of concha creation has been an exciting journey. It all began as a hobby, but my love for crafting these delicious treats led to the birth of my own concha bakery. I take pride in bringing joy through personalized concha creations. Join me on this delightful adventure where I'm making moments sweeter one concha at a time.</p>
